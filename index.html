              <h3>About Puss</h3>
              <p>
                Puss in Boots, often referred to as just Puss, is the main
                protagonist of the Puss in Boots franchise. He is the main
                protagonist of the Puss in Boots movie, the sequel Puss in
                Boots: The Last Wish and the prequel Netflix Original Series The
                Adventures of Puss Boots. He is an orange&hyphen;striped cat
                that is skilled with a sword and whose name is derived from the
                hat and boots he wears. He first appeared as a bounty hunter but
                later became Shrek's faithful sidekick, until he would get tired
                and go to live his life of adventures. Loosely based on the
                fairytale character Puss in Boots as well as being a kind of
                parody of Zorro, he is a smooth&hyphen;talking cat with a
                Spanish accent, usually wearing a cavalier's hat, a belt with a
                sword, a small black cape, and small Corinthian boots. Puss
                first appears as a supporting character in Shrek 2, much like
                Dragon in the first film. He often overpowers his enemies by
                distracting them with his "cute kitten" looks. He also exhibits
                common cat behavior such as coughing up hairballs and chasing
                spotlights, usually resulting in his defeat or capture.

              <h3>Physical Appearance</h3>
              <p>
                Puss is an extremely appealing and charming Spaniard adventurer
                with a flair for the dramatic. He has a lean body with burnt
                sienna fur and darker ginger stripes running down his back,
                limbs, tail and around his head. He has lighter cream fur on his
                paws, his counter shaded belly, the sides of his snout, his chin
                and eyebrows. Thin light stripes also underline his eyes. He
                also has a noticeable courser white guard fur throughout his
                coat. His eyes have green irises, white sclera and black pupils
                which are usually narrow, or huge and round when expressing his
                cuteness. His eyelids have a noticeable dark lining, and "cat
                eye" style points at the outer corners of each eye, enhanced
                with black eyeliner. He has a little pink nose and long, white
                whiskers. His whiskers can be twined together to form a curly
                "mustache". His claws are also notable for being sharp enough to
                cut glass, and can even pick locks. He wears a black,
                broad-brimmed leather cavalier's hat, folded on the left side,
                topped with a fluffy primrose yellow plume. The hat has a dull
                red hatband, and is usually depicted with a red trim. He wears a
                black leather belt with a silver buckle sometimes in a
                double-wrapped configuration which holds his cup&hyphen;hilt
                rapier with double quillons, varying degrees of ornamentation on
                the cup, and often a pommel resembling a stylized cat head with
                pointed ears. He dons a pair of fine Corinthian-made leather
                boots, black with red lining, that covers most of his legs even
                when folded. He sometimes stores items in these boots, such as
                bottles of Catnip and his bag of gold. He often dons a black
                leather cape with a silver flower pin. His cape pin was
                redesigned to feature a silver wolf insignia instead. In some
                promotional material he is also spotted wearing gloves. In the
                Last Wish, he also grew a beard, though quickly shaved it off
                due to discomfort. He often overpowers his enemies by
                distracting them with "cute kitten" eyes. He also exhibits
                common cat behavior, such as coughing up hairballs and chasing
                spotlights, which usually results in his defeat or capture.

              <h3>Background</h3>
              <p>
                Puss used to be a wandering adventurer after having been exiled
                from his hometown, San Ricardo. His early life in San Ricardo
                had been one of mischief, leading it right beside his
                partner&hyphen;in&hyphen;crime, Humpty Alexander Dumpty. His
                path, however, had officially diverged from his friend's after
                he was declared a town hero for saving the Comandante's mother.
                He was rewarded with his signatures cavalier hat, belt, sword,
                and boots, earning the name Puss in Boots. Inspired by his
                adoptive mother, Imelda, he has since led a life of honor and
                valor. A betrayal from the extremely hurt and jealous Humpty
                Dumpty led him to be cast out from his hometown. He had been
                tricked into robbing the San Ricardo Bank and was forced to
                leave. At one point in his exile, he encountered El Guante
                Blanco (literally 'The White Glove') who endeavored to mentor
                his swordsmanship, even having claimed to have helped him
                perfect his spinning&hyphen;through&hyphen;the&hyphen;air trick.
                The Master and apprentice have since went on their separate
                ways.

              <h3>Early Life</h3>
              <p>
                Puss was abandoned as a kitten in a basket, which somehow found
                its way to the doorstep of an orphanage in a Spanish town called
                San Ricardo. He was taken in by the head of the orphanage,
                Imelda, who became his foster mother. Puss befriended a young
                Humpty Alexander Dumpty, who gave him his name Puss, and they
                became brothers in heart with a dream: To find the Magic Beans
                so they may find the Giant's Castle and get the Golden Eggs of
                the Golden Goose, setting themselves up for life. Throughout
                their childhood, Puss and Humpty got in and out of trouble,
                stealing various beans in their search for the magic beans until
                one day, Puss saved the mother of the Captain of the Guard
                (Comandante) from a bull, and was regarded as a hero when Imelda
                gave him a pair of boots to wear with pride. This event,
                however, drove a wedge between Puss and Humpty as Puss didn't
                want to steal anymore while Humpty continued and thought Puss
                was breaking their promise. One night, Humpty tricked Puss into
                helping him rob a bank. The chase ended at a bridge where the
                money fell over the bridge and was lost, and Humpty fell and
                couldn't get back up as he begged Puss to help him. Angry that
                Humpty had tricked him and branded him an outlaw, Puss told him
                to help himself, left him to the guards and fled San Ricardo.

                    Cool and well&hyphen;groomed, Kitty knows how to be
                    persuasive without ever being a damsel in distress. She can
                    be testy but never falters under pressure. At first, she
                    cared only about stealing the golden eggs, but that changes
                    when she meets Puss. She is incredibly clever, civilized and
                    persuasive to all, especially to Puss. She can be sweet
                    whenever she wants to, but destructive at times. She has
                    been shown to be humorous at times, as seen when she would
                    tease Puss. It was noted she is called Soft&hyphen;paws
                    because she can steal things away from people without their
                    ever noticing. She proves this by stealing Puss's hat, bag
                    of money, and boots, just to tease him at all times. While
                    she and Puss are riding on the wagon, she reveals she
                    doesn't have any claws.

                  <p>
                    Being a mastermind, Humpty was very clever and was able to
                    invent extraordinary devices and manipulate unwitting people
                    like Puss into doing his dirty work. He was also quite
                    greedy and a backstabber as he framed Puss for his crime and
                    nearly got the town destroyed just because he didn't want to
                    return the goose. He also has delusions of grandeur,
                    believing himself to deserve far more than what his lot in
                    life offered him. He was very ambitious and adventurous
                    since childhood, wanting to make it big with a golden
                    goose's gold eggs despite it being considered not much more
                    than folklore. He is a gaslighter, trying to cause Puss to
                    doubt his morality and believe he is responsible for the
                    misfortunes that has befallen himself and San Ricardo. He is
                    also is shown to hold grudges, and does not forgive or
                    forget easily, demonstrated by how he held a grudge against
                    Puss for "betraying" him since childhood.

                    Perrito is a happy&hyphen;go&hyphen;lucky, optimistic dog
                    whose goal is to be a therapy dog in the future. He is
                    easily trusting and naive, but he never fails to see the
                    best in everyone and everything. He views his abandonment as
                    a game, and willingly tells his tragic story as if it were a
                    funny anecdote. He makes the best out of everything, shown
                    by how unfazed he was when talking about his backstory, in
                    which he was thrown off to a river inside a sock and he made
                    the best of it by getting a "free sweater" out of the sock.

                    Death is a cunning and sinister individual whose sole
                    purpose is to take the souls of the deceased. Although he
                    waits in the shadows for people to die naturally, if someone
                    angers or offends him enough, he will physically manifest in
                    order to attempt to take their life by force.
